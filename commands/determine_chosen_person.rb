# Purpose: Determine the chosen person for a Transaction Tag
# 
# How to use: DetermineChosenPerson.new(ribon, non_profit).call
# 
# How it works: It will choose a person based on the following rules:
# 1. If the person has donated more than 10k, it will be chosen 50% of the time
# 2. If the person has donated less than 10k, it will be chosen 50% of the time
# 3. If there are no people that have donated more than 10k, it will choose a person randomly
#
# How to improve: This class is doing too much. It should be split into smaller classes, specially the choose_rule_grops method.
#
#
# RULE GROUPS STRUCTURE
#
# 1 - MAKE IT BE 50/50 AT FIRST, OR FULL BIG DONORS DEPENDING OF THE AMOUNT OF PAYMENTS
# 2 - THE BIG DONORS SLICE IS DISTRIBUTED PROPORTIONALY TO EACH AMOUNT
# 3 - IF SOME BIG DONOR HAVE 10% TO BE USED, HE WILL BE PRIORITIZED
#
#
# ASSUMPTIONS I MADE: 
# THE 3RD RULE (TO CHECK IF SOME BIG DONOR HAS -10%) NEEDS TO RUN FIRST AND RETURN THEM
# THE 1ST AND 2ND RULE NEEDS TO RUN TOGETHER. LETS SUPPOSE THE FOLLOWING SCENERIES:
#
# FIRST ONE:
#
#        1 - ALL PROMOTERS HAVE $30.000
#        2 - RICHARLISON   HAVE $30.000
#        3 - LIONEL MESSI  HAVE $40.000
#        X - TOTAL             $100.000
#
# WHEN THE SUM OF ALL PROMOTERS IS LOWER THAN ALL BIG DONORS, THEY CAN BE TREATED AS A
# HUGE BIG DONOR. SO:
#
#        1 - ALL PROMOTERS WILL BE CHOSEN 30% OF TIME
#        2 - RICHARLISON   WILL BE CHOSEN 30% OF TIME
#        3 - LIONEL MESSI  WILL BE CHOSEN 40% OF TIME
#        X - TOTAL                       100%
#
#
# SECOND ONE:
#
#        1 - ALL PROMOTERS HAVE $60.000
#        2 - RICHARLISON   HAVE $30.000
#        3 - LIONEL MESSI  HAVE $10.000
#        X - TOTAL             $100.000
#
# ALL PROMOTERS HAVE MORE THAN ALL BIG DONORS, SO IT WILL BE:
#
#        1 - ALL PROMOTERS WILL BE CHOSEN 50%   OF TIME
#        2 - RICHARLISON   WILL BE CHOSEN 37,5% OF TIME
#        3 - LIONEL MESSI  WILL BE CHOSEN 12,5% OF TIME
#        X - TOTAL                       100%
#
# THE PROMOTERS PROBABILITY IS LIMITED TO 50%, AND THE ORHERS 50% ARE DISTRIBUTED
# PROPORTIONALLY PER BIG DONOR
